Creating conversions in Google Ads based on key events in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) allows you to track valuable actions users take on your website and use that data for optimized ad targeting. Here’s how to do it:

1. Set Up Events in GA4 as Conversions
Open Google Analytics 4 and go to Admin > Events.
Identify the events you want to use as conversions (e.g., "purchase," "form_submission").
If an event is not yet marked as a conversion, toggle the Mark as conversion button next to it.

2. Link Google Ads to Google Analytics 4
In GA4, go to Admin > Product Links > Google Ads Links.
Click Link and select your Google Ads account.
Follow the prompts to complete the linking process, enabling data sharing between GA4 and Google Ads.

3. Import GA4 Conversions into Google Ads
Open Google Ads and go to Tools & Settings > Conversions.
Click New Conversion Action and select Import.
Choose Google Analytics (GA4) events and click Continue.
Select the specific GA4 conversion events you marked (e.g., "purchase," "form_submission") and click Import and Continue.

4. Verify and Customize Conversion Settings
Once imported, click on each conversion action to verify details, including Conversion window, Attribution model, and Value assignment.
Customize as needed based on the importance of each event for your campaign goals.

5. Use the Conversions in Google Ads Campaigns
In your Google Ads campaigns, ensure Optimize for conversions is selected in the Bidding section.
Monitor the performance of your conversions over time, adjusting bids and budgets to optimize for high-value actions based on GA4 data.
This integration improves campaign performance as it allows Google Ads to leverage GA4’s event-based tracking, providing a deeper understanding of user actions.
