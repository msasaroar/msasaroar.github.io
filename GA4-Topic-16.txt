GA4 #16: What Are Dimensions & Metrics in GA4?
Dimensions and metrics are fundamental concepts in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) that you’ll use regularly for reporting, analysis, and tracking user behavior. Understanding the difference between them and how to use them effectively is crucial for analyzing data in GA4.

1. Introduction to Dimensions and Metrics
Dimensions: Qualitative attributes or characteristics of the data. These are attributes that describe the data. For example, the page title, user country, or device type are all dimensions.
Metrics: Quantitative measurements of the data. These are the values that measure the performance of the dimensions. For example, the number of users, session duration, or pageviews are all metrics.
In simple terms:

Dimensions tell you "what" happened.
Metrics tell you "how much" or "how often" something happened.

2. Common Examples of Dimensions and Metrics
Dimensions:

Page Title (e.g., "Homepage")
Source (e.g., "Google", "Direct")
Device Category (e.g., "mobile", "desktop")
User Location (e.g., "United States")
Event Name (e.g., "button_click", "video_play")
Browser (e.g., "Chrome", "Firefox")
Metrics:

Sessions (the number of sessions on the site)
Users (the number of users visiting the site)
Pageviews (the number of page views)
Engagement Time (the time users engaged with the website)
Conversions (the number of conversion events)
Event Count (the number of times a specific event was triggered)
3. Step-by-Step Activities to Learn About Dimensions & Metrics in GA4
Step 1: Understand the Default Dimensions and Metrics in GA4
GA4 provides a set of default dimensions and metrics that are automatically tracked for you. You don’t need to do anything extra to track these; they come with the standard setup of GA4.

Go to Explore in the GA4 interface.
Start a Blank Exploration.
In the Variables section, you'll see a list of available Dimensions and Metrics.
Dimensions are listed first under Dimensions, and metrics are under Metrics.
Examples of default dimensions and metrics in GA4:

Dimensions: Page Title, Source/Medium, Device Category, City, Country, Session Source, etc.
Metrics: Users, Sessions, Pageviews, Engaged Sessions, Average Engagement Time, Conversions, etc.
Step 2: Using Dimensions and Metrics in a Report
Go to the "Explore" Section:

Open the Explore section in GA4 and start a Blank Exploration.
Choose a Template (Optional):

You can use predefined templates like Free Form, Funnel Exploration, or Path Exploration for more structured reporting.
Drag and Drop Dimensions and Metrics:

From the Variables section, drag a dimension (e.g., Page Title) into the Rows section.
Drag a metric (e.g., Pageviews) into the Values section.
Customize the Report:

You can add multiple dimensions and metrics. For example, you could combine Device Category with Page Title to see how different devices interact with different pages.
Filter the report by specific criteria, such as filtering for just Organic traffic sources or focusing only on specific pages.
Analyze the Report:

Once the data is displayed, look at the combinations of dimensions and metrics to analyze user behavior.
For example, if you combine Device Category with Users, you can determine how many users accessed the site via mobile vs desktop.
Step 3: Creating Custom Dimensions and Metrics (Optional)
While GA4 offers many default dimensions and metrics, you might need to create custom dimensions and custom metrics based on the data you want to track.

Custom Dimensions:

Custom dimensions allow you to track specific information about your users or events.
For example, you could create a custom dimension to track the user role (admin, editor, viewer) on your site if you're running a membership site.
How to create a custom dimension:

Go to Admin > Property > Custom Definitions.
Click Create Custom Dimension.
Enter the name, scope (event or user), and description of the custom dimension.
Define the event parameter or user property that will be used to capture this custom dimension.
Custom Metrics:

Custom metrics are numeric values that you can track in addition to the default metrics GA4 provides.
For example, you might want to track the number of form submissions on your site.
How to create a custom metric:

Go to Admin > Property > Custom Definitions.
Click Create Custom Metric.
Enter the necessary information like the name, description, and event parameter you want to measure (e.g., form_submissions).
Step 4: Using Dimensions and Metrics for Analysis
Once you have your dimensions and metrics set up, use them for analysis:

Segmentation: Use dimensions to segment data. For example, you can break down your users by device type, location, or traffic source.
Trends and Patterns: Look for patterns and trends over time. For example, do users from a specific country visit more pages than users from another country?
Conversions: Measure conversions using both dimensions and metrics. For example, track how many users (dimension) completed a specific action (metric like purchase or sign-up).
Step 5: Create Custom Reports Using Dimensions and Metrics
Custom reports allow you to focus on the exact data you want to see.

Go to Explore: Open a Blank Exploration or use a predefined template like Free Form.
Drag Dimensions and Metrics into Rows and Columns.
Apply Filters (optional): For example, filter by Device Category to only see data for desktop users.
Analyze: Study how different dimensions and metrics relate to each other, helping you answer key business questions like:
Which pages are the most visited on desktop vs mobile?
What is the average session duration by country?
Which traffic sources lead to the most conversions?

4. Summary of Dimensions and Metrics in GA4
Dimensions are qualitative attributes (e.g., page title, user location, traffic source).
Metrics are quantitative measures (e.g., pageviews, users, sessions, event count).
Default Dimensions and Metrics are automatically tracked in GA4.
You can create custom dimensions and metrics to track specific data points relevant to your business.
Use Explore to combine dimensions and metrics for in-depth analysis.

By mastering dimensions and metrics, you’ll be able to create more detailed and tailored reports, perform better analysis, and make data-driven decisions to optimize your website or app’s performance.
