To verify that Google Ads and Google Analytics 4 (GA4) are successfully connected, follow these steps:

1. Check in Google Analytics 4
Go to GA4: Open your GA4 property and navigate to Admin.
Under Property Settings:
Click on Google Ads Links under the "Product Links" section.
Look for your Google Ads account in the list. If it’s showing as “Active,” then the connection is established.

2. Verify in Google Ads
Open Google Ads: Log into the Google Ads account you connected.
Go to Tools and Settings: Click on the wrench icon in the top-right corner.
Linked Accounts:
Under "Setup," select Linked Accounts.
In the Linked Accounts section, locate Google Analytics (GA4).
Your linked GA4 property should appear here, indicating that the link is active.

3. Monitor Data Flow in GA4
Wait for Data Transfer: It may take a few hours for data to start flowing between GA4 and Google Ads.
Check Audience Data:
Go to Reports > Acquisition > Google Ads in GA4.
You should start to see Google Ads data such as clicks, cost, and conversions in your GA4 reports within 24 hours.
Real-Time Report: Open Reports > Realtime to see if any current sessions are coming from Google Ads campaigns.

4. Verify Conversions (Optional)
If you’ve set up specific conversions to be shared from GA4 to Google Ads, go to Tools and Settings > Conversions in Google Ads and check that the GA4 conversions are listed as active.

5. Use DebugView in GA4 (Optional)
To confirm that specific Google Ads-related events (like clicks or conversions) are being logged, go to Configure > DebugView in GA4. If you have debug mode enabled on your website or app, you should see the events associated with Google Ads clicks or interactions here.

6. Run a Test Campaign (Optional)
To be fully certain that data is flowing correctly, consider running a small test campaign in Google Ads.
Use campaign parameters to verify that traffic and conversions show up in GA4 under Acquisition > Traffic Acquisition with proper Google Ads data.

Following these steps will confirm that the integration is working properly and that data is successfully flowing between Google Ads and Google Analytics 4.
