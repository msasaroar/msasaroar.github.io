    "In 30 years, I’ve done nothing,
    and I don't think I can do anything now.
    I've grown old,
    have no income or earnings.
    Now it's your responsibility to arrange treatment for your mother.
    Please free me from this burden.
    
    If you feel it necessary, keep a record of whatever expenses you make.
    If I’m unable to pay, you can take land from me equivalent to the costs.
    And if I die, you can recover the dues from the sale of my share."
