GA4 #06, “What is the Acquisition Report in GA4,” learning activities should focus on understanding how users arrive at your site and what channels or sources are most effective in bringing in traffic. The GA4 Acquisition Report helps identify key sources, mediums, and campaigns that drive user engagement, making it a valuable tool for marketers, analysts, and site owners.


Step-by-Step Activities for GA4 #06: Understanding the Acquisition Report


1. Navigate to the Acquisition Report

Access GA4: Log in to your Google Analytics 4 account and open the property you want to analyze.

Locate the Report: In the left-hand menu, click on Reports > Acquisition. The Acquisition report in GA4 is divided into multiple sub-reports, including User Acquisition and Traffic Acquisition.


2. Understand the Key Acquisition Report Sections

User Acquisition Report: This report shows how first-time users found your site, categorized by channel, source, and medium.

Traffic Acquisition Report: This shows session-based data, indicating how all sessions (not just first-time users) are initiated on your site, which gives a more holistic view of ongoing traffic sources.

Primary Dimensions: The main dimensions in Acquisition are Default Channel Grouping, Source / Medium, and Campaign. These help you understand where users came from, such as organic search, paid search, social media, or direct traffic.


3. Explore the Metrics in the Acquisition Report

Engaged Sessions: Engaged sessions refer to sessions where users interact with the site for a certain amount of time, perform conversions, or view multiple pages. This metric indicates the quality of traffic from each channel.

Engagement Rate: The engagement rate measures the percentage of engaged sessions versus total sessions, showing how well a channel attracts high-quality users.

Conversions: Conversions are events marked as significant business outcomes. In the Acquisition report, conversions help identify which sources are driving users to complete desired actions.

User Metrics: Review metrics like New Users and Total Users to gauge the number of new and returning visitors from each source.


4. Customize the Report for Detailed Analysis

Add Secondary Dimensions: Click on the + icon next to the primary dimension (e.g., Default Channel Grouping) to add a secondary dimension, such as Device Category or Location. This allows you to see how different devices or regions affect traffic quality.

Apply Filters: Use filters to refine the data, such as filtering by a specific region, campaign, or medium to analyze particular segments.

Use Date Ranges: Adjust the date range to see data for a specific period. Comparing different date ranges helps in understanding how acquisition patterns have changed over time.


5. Analyze Channel Performance

Compare Channels by Engagement: Look at which channels have the highest engagement rate, indicating where engaged users are coming from.

Identify High-Converting Channels: See which sources or mediums bring in users who are most likely to convert, allowing you to prioritize resources for high-performing channels.

Evaluate New User Sources: In the User Acquisition report, determine which channels drive the highest volume of new users to your site. This can help in planning marketing strategies focused on user growth.


6. Use Insights for Campaign Optimization

Find Opportunities for Growth: Look for channels with good engagement but low traffic volume—these may be potential growth areas.

Adjust Marketing Spend: Use data on which channels drive conversions to inform decisions on advertising spend and campaign focus.

Identify Campaign Success: If you’re running multiple campaigns, compare each campaign’s metrics to see which ones attract the most engaged users or lead to the highest conversion rates.


7. Utilize Additional Tools for Deeper Analysis

Explore Feature: Go to Explore > Free Form Exploration and create a custom exploration based on acquisition data for a more advanced, customized view of user sources.

Debug with Real-time Report: If you’re testing acquisition efforts (such as tracking a new campaign), check the Realtime report to see if traffic is arriving from the desired sources immediately after implementation.


8. Regularly Review and Report Findings

Document and Share Insights: Create a report summarizing key findings, like which channels are performing well and which need improvement. This can help in making data-driven decisions on optimizing user acquisition.

Set Up Alerts: Consider setting up alerts or automated reports for sudden changes in traffic or engagement from key channels to monitor campaign health in real time.


By following these steps, you’ll gain hands-on experience with GA4’s Acquisition Report and develop a deeper understanding of how users are finding your website, the quality of traffic each source provides, and how to optimize campaigns based on traffic insights. This report is central to improving user acquisition and making informed marketing decisions.
