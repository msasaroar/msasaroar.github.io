Seeking Help !!!!!!!!
I have implemented several GA4-recommended eCommerce events according to the GA4 schema.
I have also carefully configured the relevant tags in both the GTM Web and Server containers.
All tags are firing correctly on both the client and server sides.
Similarly, all events appear in the GA4 Debug View except the 'purchase' and 'refund' events.
I'm exhausted trying to figure out the cause behind this.
What could be the possible reasons why the purchase and refund events are not showing up in the Debug View?
Could I please get help from an experienced member?
