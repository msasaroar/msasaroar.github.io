In Google Analytics 4 (GA4), "lead generation" refers to tracking when a potential customer expresses interest in your product or service, 
usually by completing an action that identifies them—like filling out a contact form, signing up for a newsletter, or requesting a quote.



🔍 In GA4 terms:
There’s no predefined event called `lead` — you have to create a custom event (e.g., `generate_lead`) to track it. 
This aligns with how GA4 works: you define what’s important to your business.

✅ Typical lead generation actions to track:
- Contact form submission  
- Newsletter signup  
- Free trial sign-up  
- Quote request  
- Account creation

🔧 How to track lead generation in GA4:
1. Trigger the event in your site/app code or via Google Tag Manager (GTM)  
   Example event name: `generate_lead`

2. Send relevant parameters (optional but useful for reporting):  
   ```json
   {
     "event": "generate_lead",
     "method": "Contact Form",
     "lead_type": "Consultation"
   }
   ```

3. Mark it as a conversion in GA4:
   - Go to Admin > Events
   - Find `generate_lead` or create it
   - Toggle Mark as conversion

 📊 Example use cases:
- You run Facebook Ads to a landing page → user fills out a form → GTM fires `generate_lead` → tracked as a conversion in GA4.

 💡 Pro tip:
Use GTM to easily detect form submissions or button clicks and fire the `generate_lead` event without touching code.
