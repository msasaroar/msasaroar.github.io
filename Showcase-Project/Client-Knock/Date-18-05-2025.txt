Hi,

Thank you for reaching out!
Apologies for the delayed response â€” I was offline due to time zone differences.

At the moment, I specialize in Google Tag Manager (GTM) setup, including tracking implementation for Google Ads, GA4, and other marketing platforms. I donâ€™t currently offer full Google Ads Marketing and Campaign Management services.

However, if youâ€™re looking for help with conversion tracking, remarketing tag setup, or any kind of GTM implementation related to Google Ads, Iâ€™d be happy to assist.

As for availability, Iâ€™m generally available for 2â€“5 hours per day, typically between 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM BST (GMT+6).
Let me know if that works for your schedule, and how I can assist you best.

Best regards,
Saiful Alam
