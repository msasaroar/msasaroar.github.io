GA4 #05: What is the Realtime Report in GA4

The Realtime Report in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) provides you with a live view of user activity on your website or app, helping you to monitor visitor behavior and campaign performance as it happens. Here’s a detailed, step-by-step guide to learn and make the most of the Realtime Report in GA4.


Step 1: Access the Realtime Report
Log in to Google Analytics and navigate to your GA4 property.
In the left-hand navigation panel, go to Reports > Realtime.
This brings up the Realtime dashboard, where you can see an overview of live user activity.


Step 2: Explore Key Metrics in Realtime
Users in the Last 30 Minutes:

At the top, you’ll see a snapshot of the number of active users within the last 30 minutes, showing how many users are currently on your site or app.
User Source: It displays the channels (e.g., organic search, direct, referral) these users came from, helping you understand where your traffic originates.
View Realtime User Locations:

Below the active users, you’ll find a map visualization showing the geographic location of live users.
Hover over a region to see the exact number of active users in each location, which is useful for analyzing regional traffic patterns.


Step 3: Understand User Activities in Realtime
Top Event Count by Event Name:

In the Event count by Event name section, you can see the top events users are engaging with, such as page views, button clicks, or video plays.
This helps you monitor specific user actions in real-time, which is useful for evaluating the immediate impact of new content, sales, or marketing campaigns.
View Page or Screen View Data:

Under Page title and screen class, see which pages or screens are being viewed by users right now.
This can help you quickly identify high-traffic pages and evaluate if specific campaigns or promotions are driving visitors to particular pages.
Traffic Sources in Realtime:

Below the page views, the Source/Medium table shows where your active users are coming from.
This helps you quickly understand which marketing channels are performing best in real-time.


Step 4: Filter the Realtime Report by User Segment
Add Comparison Segments:

Click Add comparison to filter and compare different segments (e.g., “New vs. Returning Users” or specific geographic regions).
You can select predefined or custom user segments to focus on particular types of users or behaviors.
Use Segment Overlap for Multi-Segment Analysis:

GA4 allows for the comparison of multiple segments, like visitors from different regions or devices, directly within the Realtime report.
You can use these insights to understand which segments are engaging more actively with certain types of content.


Step 5: Monitor Events and Conversions in Realtime
Track Events in Realtime:

As you view the report, keep an eye on key events you’ve set up, such as clicks, form submissions, or scroll tracking.
If you’ve marked events as Conversions, they will show up here and can help you see which users are completing critical actions in real-time.
Test New Events and Goals:

When you set up new events or conversions, use the Realtime report to test if they’re firing correctly.
Perform the action on your website or app (e.g., clicking a button or submitting a form) and check the Realtime report to verify if the event is tracked immediately.


Step 6: Evaluate Realtime Campaign Performance
Analyze Campaign Results:

If you’re running a marketing campaign (such as an email or social media ad), use the Realtime report to monitor the immediate impact on traffic and user behavior.
Look at the Source/Medium data to determine which campaigns are bringing the most visitors in real-time.
Track Changes in User Behavior:

Keep an eye on how users respond to on-site changes, like new blog posts, product launches, or time-sensitive offers.
Watch for spikes in active users or specific events, indicating strong engagement with your updates.


Step 7: Check Insights and Troubleshoot Real-Time Data
Investigate Drops or Surges in Traffic:

If you notice sudden changes, use the Realtime report to quickly diagnose potential issues or opportunities, such as broken links, unexpected surges from a new campaign, or website downtime.
Use Debug Mode for Testing:

GA4’s DebugView, found under Configure > DebugView, works alongside the Realtime report and can help validate that new events are firing as expected.
This is especially useful for verifying that GA4 tags, events, and parameters are working correctly.


Step 8: Practice and Review Insights Regularly
Make a Habit of Checking Realtime:
Regularly review the Realtime report to stay updated on your site’s live performance, particularly during peak traffic times, campaign launches, or after site updates.
By exploring and monitoring the Realtime report in GA4, you’ll gain essential skills in real-time data analysis, troubleshooting, and campaign evaluation. This real-time insight can be pivotal for making quick adjustments and optimizing user engagement as it happens.
