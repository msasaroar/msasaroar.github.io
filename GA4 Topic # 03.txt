GA4 #03: Get Access to Google Analytics Demo Account

The Google Analytics Demo Account is a free resource provided by Google, allowing users to explore a fully functional Google Analytics 4 (GA4) account without needing to set up their own website tracking. The demo account is linked to Google’s merchandise store, offering real-world data to practice analysis, report creation, and event tracking. Here are the steps to access and learn from the GA4 Demo Account:


Step 1: Accessing the Demo Account
Go to the Demo Account Signup Page:
Open your browser and go to Google Analytics Demo Account.
Sign in with Your Google Account:
Log in to your Google account if you haven’t already.
Add the Demo Account:
Click on the Access Demo Account button. This action will grant you read-only access to Google’s GA4 property for the Google Merchandise Store.


Step 2: Navigating the Demo Account Dashboard
Open the Demo Property:
Once in Google Analytics, navigate to the GA4 property of the Google Merchandise Store.
Explore Key Sections:
Go through different sections such as Reports, Explore, and Configure to get a sense of the available data and analysis options in GA4.


Step 3: Explore Key GA4 Reports in the Demo Account
Realtime Report:
Go to Reports > Realtime to observe active users on the Google Merchandise Store website in real time.
Watch how real-time data reflects user locations, active pages, and events as they happen on the site.
Acquisition Report:
Access Reports > Acquisition to see how users are coming to the site (e.g., organic search, direct, paid ads).
Study the sources and mediums to understand how GA4 attributes traffic.
Engagement Report:
In Reports > Engagement, observe metrics like user engagement, average engagement time, and user retention.
Check out Events under Engagement to view detailed data on key interactions, such as page views, scrolls, and clicks.
User Report:
Explore Reports > User to analyze user demographics, interests, and lifetime value.


Step 4: Practicing Customization with Explorations
Create Custom Explorations:
Go to Explore in GA4, select a report type (e.g., Free Form, Funnel, or Path Analysis), and start a new exploration.
Use dimensions and metrics in the demo account to customize reports according to specific questions or analysis goals.
Experiment with Segmentation:
In Explorations, add segments (like new vs. returning users) to analyze different user types and their behavior.
Use Funnel Analysis:
Set up a funnel to track the steps users take on the Google Merchandise Store, such as navigating from the homepage to a product page to a purchase page.


Step 5: Review Key GA4 Metrics and Dimensions
Analyze Dimensions and Metrics:
Go through the various dimensions (e.g., user location, traffic source) and metrics (e.g., sessions, conversions) available in the demo account.
Practice Filtering Data:
Apply filters to your reports (e.g., by specific geographic location or traffic source) to understand the behavior of specific user segments.


Step 6: Practice with Event Tracking
Examine Existing Events:
In the Configure > Events section, review all the events automatically tracked, like page views, button clicks, and purchases.
Mark Events as Conversions:
Identify any events you would consider significant (e.g., "purchase") and observe how they are marked as conversions.
Use DebugView to Simulate Event Tracking:
While DebugView won’t be fully operational on the demo account, you can still observe how it works for event tracking by setting up a similar configuration on your own property later.


Step 7: Create and Analyze Audiences
Explore Pre-Set Audiences:
Go to Configure > Audiences to see the pre-set audiences in the demo account, such as users from different geographic regions or those who completed certain actions.
Experiment with Custom Audiences:
Create custom audience definitions based on user behavior or demographics, which you can later test on your own GA4 property.


Step 8: Additional Practice Tips
Use Google’s Learning Hub:
Visit Google’s Analytics Academy for guided lessons on GA4 using the demo account.
Take Notes on Differences from UA:
Keep a record of how GA4 differs in structure, metrics, and analysis options compared to Google Universal Analytics if you’re transitioning from UA.
Following these steps will help you navigate and maximize your learning from the GA4 Demo Account, enabling you to get hands-on practice with real-world analytics data without setting up a property. Let me know if you’d like to dive deeper into any specific reports or analyses!
