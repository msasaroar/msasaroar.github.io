GA4 # 15: Custom Events in GA4 Using Google Tag Manager (GTM)
Creating custom events in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) using Google Tag Manager (GTM) allows you to track specific user interactions that are not automatically captured by GA4. Custom events provide a way to understand unique actions on your website, like button clicks, form submissions, video interactions, and more.

Step-by-Step Guide for Setting Up Custom Events in GA4 Using GTM

Prerequisites
GA4 property set up and tracking code installed on your website.
GTM container installed on your website.
GA4 configuration tag created in GTM.

Step 1: Define the Custom Event
Decide on the specific interaction(s) you want to track as a custom event. Some common examples include:

Button clicks (e.g., “Subscribe” button)
Form submissions
Video interactions (e.g., play, pause)

Step 2: Create a Trigger in GTM for the Event
Log in to Google Tag Manager and open the container for your website.
In the left-hand menu, click on Triggers.
Click on New to create a new trigger.
Name your trigger (e.g., “Subscribe Button Click Trigger”).
Choose the appropriate Trigger Type:
For button clicks, choose Click - All Elements or Click - Just Links.
For form submissions, choose Form Submission.
Set Trigger Conditions:
Use conditions like CSS selectors or specific URLs to narrow down the target element for the trigger.
Example: To track clicks on a “Subscribe” button, you could specify a CSS selector that matches the button’s unique ID or class.

Save the trigger.

Step 3: Set Up the GA4 Event Tag in GTM
In GTM, go to Tags and click on New to create a new tag.

Name the Tag appropriately (e.g., “GA4 Subscribe Button Click”).

Click on Tag Configuration and select GA4 Event as the tag type.

Configure the Event Tag:

Configuration Tag: Choose your existing GA4 configuration tag.
Event Name: Enter a unique name for your custom event, such as subscribe_click.
Event Parameters: Add any parameters that provide additional details about the event:
Parameter Name: For example, button_name.
Value: Enter a value or variable. You can choose a static text or create a GTM variable to dynamically capture the button’s text.
Set Triggering: Click on the Triggering section and select the trigger you created in Step 2 (e.g., “Subscribe Button Click Trigger”).

Save the tag.

Step 4: Preview and Test the Tag
In GTM, click on Preview to enter preview mode.
Open your website in the new preview tab.
Perform the action that should trigger the event (e.g., click the “Subscribe” button).
In the Tag Assistant window, verify that your GA4 custom event tag fired as expected.

Step 5: Publish the GTM Container
Once the tag is successfully tested, go back to GTM and click Submit.
Add a version name and description, then click Publish.

Step 6: Verify Custom Event in GA4
Go to Google Analytics 4 and open the property for your website.
Click on Reports > Realtime to see if the custom event is showing up in real-time data.
To view the event in your Events section, navigate to Configure > Events. Your custom event (e.g., subscribe_click) should appear here within 24 hours after users trigger it.

Step 7: Mark the Event as a Conversion (Optional)
If the custom event represents a significant action (like a subscription or purchase), you can mark it as a conversion:

Go to Configure > Events in GA4.
Find your custom event in the list.
Toggle Mark as conversion to mark this event as a conversion.

Following these steps will help you set up, track, and analyze custom events in GA4 using GTM. By creating these custom events, you’ll gain more insight into specific user behaviors on your website, allowing you to make data-driven decisions to improve engagement and conversions.
