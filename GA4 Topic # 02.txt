GA4 #02: Install Google Analytics 4 on a Website
Installing Google Analytics 4 (GA4) on a website involves creating a property in GA4, setting up a data stream, and adding the tracking code to your website. Here are the step-by-step details:

Step 1: Create a GA4 Property
Log into Google Analytics: Go to analytics.google.com and sign in with your Google account.
Create a New GA4 Property:
Go to the Admin section (found at the bottom left).
In the Account column, select the account you want or create a new account if needed.
In the Property column, click on Create Property.
Enter a name for your property, set the reporting time zone and currency, and click Next.
Configure business details as prompted, then click Create to finalize the GA4 property.
Step 2: Set Up a Data Stream for Your Website
Choose Data Stream Type:
Once your GA4 property is created, select Web as the platform type (for tracking a website).
Add Website Information:
Enter your website URL and provide a name for the data stream.
Enable Enhanced Measurement (this automatically tracks basic interactions like page views, scrolls, outbound clicks, etc.).
Create Stream: Click Create Stream to generate a unique Measurement ID for your website (it will look like "G-XXXXXXXXXX").
Step 3: Add GA4 Tag to Your Website
Access the Global Site Tag (gtag.js):
On the Data Stream page, you’ll see a Measurement ID and tracking instructions. Copy the entire gtag.js script under Global site tag.
Insert the Script in Your Website:
Paste the gtag.js script in the <head> section of your website’s HTML, just before the closing </head> tag.
Save and Publish: Save the changes and publish the updated HTML on your server to start tracking.
Step 4: Verify Installation
Use Google Tag Assistant:
Open your website in a browser and use the Google Tag Assistant Chrome extension to confirm that the GA4 tag is firing correctly.
Check Real-Time Report in GA4:
Go back to Google Analytics and navigate to Realtime under the Reports section.
Visit your website on a separate browser tab, and you should see the activity reflected in the Realtime report within a few seconds.
Step 5: Enable Basic Tracking Features
Enhanced Measurement:
In your GA4 property, go to Admin > Data Streams and select your website stream.
Make sure Enhanced Measurement is enabled to automatically track events like page views, scrolls, outbound clicks, and site searches.
Enable Debug Mode (optional for testing):
In GA4, activate DebugView by enabling Debug mode in your tracking code or using a Chrome extension like Google Analytics Debugger.
Step 6: Set Up Goals or Conversions (Optional)
Mark Events as Conversions:
Go to Configure > Events in GA4.
Find events you want to count as conversions (e.g., "purchase" or "sign_up") and toggle Mark as conversion.
Step 7: Test and Validate
Test Different Scenarios:
Trigger events on your website (e.g., page views, clicks) to confirm data is flowing to GA4.
Review Real-Time and DebugView:
Navigate to Reports > Realtime and Configure > DebugView to monitor the events and ensure accurate tracking.
Following these steps will set up GA4 on your website and begin capturing user data. Let me know if you have any specific questions about a step!
