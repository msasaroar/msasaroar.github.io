			Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is Google’s latest analytics platform designed to provide deeper insights and greater flexibility in understanding user behavior across websites and apps. Unlike its predecessor, Universal Analytics, GA4 adopts an event-based model that allows for more granular tracking of user interactions and provides a holistic view of the customer journey across different devices and platforms. It empowers businesses with advanced features like real-time reporting, cross-platform tracking, and predictive insights that help forecast user behavior trends. By using GA4, companies can track custom events, optimize marketing efforts, and make data-driven decisions that enhance user experience and business outcomes.

			Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a powerful tag management system that simplifies the process of adding, managing, and controlling tracking codes (tags) across websites and apps without requiring direct code modification. GTM enables marketers, analysts, and developers to implement tags for various purposes, such as tracking custom events, user interactions, conversions, and third-party integrations, without needing constant developer support. With GTM, businesses can quickly deploy and test marketing or analytics tags, ensuring accurate data collection and faster response times to new insights. This flexibility helps teams focus on optimizing their analytics setup, improving the accuracy of data, and enhancing overall site performance.
