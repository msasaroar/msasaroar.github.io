I am not ashamed of my age.
As the years go by, the body changes—wrinkles appear on the skin, strands of silver shine in the hair.
These changes don’t disturb me.
Instead, I understand that growing older means collecting new experiences.
Each year, each day, makes us more mature.

Loneliness doesn't quite defeat me either.
Over time, I’ve learned that loneliness doesn’t always mean sorrow.
Sometimes, solitude helps us truly discover ourselves.
I want my solitude to be a space for friendship with myself-A space where I can think, feel, and rediscover who I am.

But there is one fear that shakes me-That I might become a burden in someone’s life.
I don’t want my care to be seen as a hardship or a duty.
I don’t want my presence to be an added weight in someone’s life equation.

I want my age to be a symbol of respect.
I don’t want anyone to look at me with pity, But rather with the eyes that see an experienced person Who has learned from life’s journey.

I don’t want my weaknesses to be part of someone else’s story of sacrifice.
To me, aging is a deeply personal chapter-A time when I wish to savor every moment of life, slowly and mindfully.

I want my final years to be like a cup of steaming tea-With every sip carrying the warmth of memories, The sweetness of life, and the serenity of the heart.
