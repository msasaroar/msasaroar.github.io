Defining "Purchase Confirmation" in GTM
In Google Tag Manager (GTM), "Purchase Confirmation" is typically set up as an event triggered when a user successfully completes a purchase. This event is essential for tracking transactions and sending data to tools like Google Analytics 4 (GA4) or other platforms.

The Purchase Confirmation event is usually defined using:

A specific page (e.g., "Thank You" page or confirmation page).
A data layer event containing purchase details.
URL or other elements like unique text on the confirmation page.
Steps for Setting Up "Purchase Confirmation" in GTM
1. Prepare the Data Layer
If the website uses a data layer, ensure that it contains purchase information like order ID, value, currency, items, etc., and it is pushed on the confirmation page. Below is an example of a data layer:

dataLayer.push({
  event: "purchase",
  ecommerce: {
    transaction_id: "12345",
    value: 100.00,
    currency: "USD",
    items: [
      {
        item_name: "Product 1",
        price: 50.00,
        quantity: 1,
      },
      {
        item_name: "Product 2",
        price: 50.00,
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
  },
});
Note: Work with your developer to implement the appropriate data layer.

2. Create a Trigger for Purchase Confirmation
You can create a trigger to fire the tag when the purchase is confirmed.

Option A: Using Page URL
Navigate to Triggers in GTM.
Click New → Name the trigger as "Purchase Confirmation."
Choose Page View trigger type.
Set it to fire on:
Some Page Views.
Condition: Page URL contains "thank-you" (or any unique identifier of the confirmation page).
Save the trigger.
Option B: Using Data Layer Event
Click New → Name the trigger as "Purchase Data Layer Event."
Choose Custom Event trigger type.
Set the event name as purchase (or whatever event is pushed to the data layer).
Save the trigger.
3. Create a Tag for Purchase Event
Create a tag to send the purchase data to GA4 or other platforms.

For GA4:
Navigate to Tags → Click New.
Name the tag as "GA4 Purchase Event."
Select Tag Type as GA4 Event.
Select the GA4 Configuration tag or add your Measurement ID.
Set the Event Name to purchase.
Configure Event Parameters to map data layer variables:
transaction_id → {{DL - transaction_id}}
value → {{DL - value}}
currency → {{DL - currency}}
(Other parameters for items, etc., if needed.)
Assign the trigger created in Step 2.
