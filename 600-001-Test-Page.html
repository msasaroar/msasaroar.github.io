Google Analytics 4 (GA4) & Google Tag Manager (GTM) Specialist
I am a skilled specialist in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) and Google Tag Manager (GTM), with expertise in implementing tracking solutions to deliver actionable insights. I excel in configuring GA4 schema-compliant events, including e-commerce tracking (Add to Cart, Purchase, Refund) and user engagement events (Sign Up, Subscribe, Form Submissions). My proficiency extends to resolving non-compliant data layers, creating custom events, and mapping advanced data layer values. With GTM, I design and deploy complex tags, triggers, and variables, such as scroll tracking, video engagement, and custom HTML tags. I am committed to providing tailored analytics solutions that drive data-driven decision-making.
