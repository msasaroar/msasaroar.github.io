Notes:
Non-Compliant Data: The customMetadata, ctaSection, themeColor, and other fields are not standard in GA4 and would require custom dimensions or custom parameters in GTM.
Dynamic Data Layer Push: Events like form submission and video play dynamically add properties to the data layer.

GTM Setup: Map data layer variables to GA4 event parameters for effective tracking.
Would you like guidance on setting up GTM for these events?
