GTM Tracking Tasks

Page View Tracking:
Trigger : When the page is loaded.
Tag : Send pageview data to GA4 (custom event with the data layer values such as pageCategory and userStatus).
Non-Compliant Data  : Track customData like 'section' and 'contentType' which may not comply with GA4 standard properties.

CTA Button Click (Custom Event):
Trigger : When the CTA button (#ctaButton) is clicked.
Tag : Send a custom event (buttonClick) to GA4, with parameters like buttonId, buttonAction, and customEvent (e.g., 'buttonLocation').
Non-Compliant Data  : Track buttonLocation to identify where the button was clicked within the page (e.g., 'mainContent').

Video Interaction (Custom Event):
Trigger : When the video (#videoPlayer) starts playing.
Tag : Send a custom event (videoInteraction) to GA4, including video-related data like videoId, videoAction, and customVideoData.
Non-Compliant Data  : Track videoType and videoCategory, which are not part of GA4's default video interaction structure but are useful for custom reporting.

Page Scroll Depth (User Engagement):
Trigger : When the user scrolls a certain percentage down the page (e.g., 50%).
Tag : Send a scroll event (e.g., pageScroll) to GA4.
Non-Compliant Data  : Include scrollPercentage to show how far the user has scrolled without using GA4’s predefined events.

Footer Interaction (Link Click):
Trigger : When a link inside the footer (#footerLink) is clicked.
Tag : Track the link click (footerLinkClick) as an event.
Non-Compliant Data  : Include information about the link destination or content like footerLinkDestination.

Custom Data Layer Event on User Interaction:
Trigger : When a user interacts with any page element (e.g., clicking a button or interacting with a form).
Tag : Send a custom event to GA4 containing dynamic data based on the interaction (e.g., userInteraction).
Non-Compliant Data  : Push custom attributes into the data layer such as interactionType, interactionLocation, or interactionDetails that are non-standard for GA4.

Notes:
GTM can be used to create triggers for each of these actions based on the custom events (e.g., buttonClick, videoInteraction) that are pushed to the data layer.
Non-compliant data is considered non-standard, which may lead to difficulties in GA4’s reporting if not handled correctly. 
You may need to use custom dimensions, metrics, or event parameters in GA4 for such tracking.
Ensure that these custom data layers are mapped correctly in GTM and GA4 to avoid any misinterpretation of data.
