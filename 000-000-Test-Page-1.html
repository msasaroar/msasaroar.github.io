        Steps to Create a Meta Business Account:
        
        1. Log In to Your Facebook Account:
           Ensure you're logged into your personal Facebook account.
        
        2. Access Meta Business Suite:
           Navigate to [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/).
        
        3. Create a Business Portfolio:
           In the top-left corner, click on the dropdown menu.
           Select the option labeled "Create a business account" or "Create a Business Portfolio." If you don't see this option, you can directly access the creation page by visiting [business.facebook.com/create](https://business.facebook.com/create).
        
        4. Enter Business Details:
           Fill in your business name, your name, and your business email address.
           Click "Next" or "Submit" to proceed.
        
        5. Verify Your Email:
           Check your email inbox for a verification message from Meta.
           Click the verification link provided to confirm your email address.
        
        6. Set Up Business Assets:
           Once your account is created, you can add assets such as Facebook Pages, Instagram accounts, and Ad Accounts.
           To add these assets:
             Go to the "Business Settings" within Meta Business Suite.
             Navigate to the "Accounts" section.
             Select the type of asset you want to add (e.g., Pages, Ad Accounts, Instagram Accounts).
             Follow the prompts to add existing assets or create new ones.
        
        7. Assign Roles and Permissions:
           Within "Business Settings," go to the "People" section.
           Click "Add" to invite team members or partners.
           Assign appropriate roles (e.g., Admin, Employee) based on their responsibilities.
        
        8. Domain Verification (Optional but Recommended):
           If you plan to run ads or use advanced features, it's advisable to verify your domain.
           In "Business Settings," navigate to "Brand Safety" > "Domains."
           Click "Add" to enter your domain and follow the provided instructions to verify it.
        
        If you continue to experience issues or the options mentioned are not visible, it's possible that the interface has been updated or there might be regional differences. In such cases, referring to Meta's official documentation or reaching out to their support can provide further assistance.
