<h1>How to Configuring GTM with WordPress ?</h1>
<pre>
Step 1: Create a Google Tag Manager Account
Go to Google Tag Manager and sign in with your Google account.
Click Create Account and provide details:
Account Name: Your business or website name.
Container Name: Your website's domain (e.g., example.com).
Select Web as the target platform.
After creating the container, GTM will provide the tracking codes (two scripts: one for the header and one for the body).

Step 2: Add GTM Code to WordPress
Option 1: Using a Plugin
Install a GTM Plugin:
Go to your WordPress admin dashboard.
Navigate to Plugins > Add New.
Search for Google Tag Manager for WordPress by Thomas Geiger or a similar plugin.
Install and activate the plugin.
Configure the Plugin:
Go to the plugin settings (usually under Settings > Google Tag Manager).
Enter your GTM Container ID (e.g., GTM-XXXXXX).
Save changes.
Option 2: Manually Add Code
From the GTM interface, copy the GTM Header and Body Scripts.
Add them to your WordPress theme:
Go to Appearance > Theme File Editor.
Edit the header.php file and paste the Header Script just before the closing <head> tag.
Edit the footer.php file and paste the Body Script immediately after the opening <body> tag.
Save the files.

Step 3: Enable Data Layer (Optional but Recommended)
A data layer allows you to pass dynamic website information to GTM, such as user role, product details, and interactions.
Most GTM plugins provide an option to enable the data layer.
For example, in Google Tag Manager for WordPress, you can enable the data layer under the plugin’s settings.
For WooCommerce sites, enable options to send eCommerce-related data to the data layer.

Step 4: Set Up GTM Tags
Access GTM Interface:
Go to Tags > New > Tag Configuration.
Select the tag type, such as Google Analytics: GA4 Configuration.
Add Trigger:
Choose triggers like All Pages to fire the tag on every page.
Save and Publish your container.

Step 5: Test GTM Implementation
Use GTM’s Preview Mode:
Click Preview in GTM and enter your website URL.
This will launch your site in debug mode to verify that tags are firing as expected.
Use Google Tag Assistant:
Install the Tag Assistant Legacy (by Google) browser extension to verify GTM and tag functionality.

Step 6: Publish Your Changes
Once you’re confident that GTM is set up and working correctly:
Click Submit in the GTM interface.
Provide a version name and description, then publish your container.

Step 7: Periodic Maintenance
Test Regularly: Check that your GTM tags are firing after major site updates or plugin changes.
Backups: Export your GTM container for backup purposes.
Review Tags: Periodically audit your tags and triggers to ensure they align with your tracking needs.
