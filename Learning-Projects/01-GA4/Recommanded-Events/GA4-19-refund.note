Q2ChatGPT >>> In GTM, the tag for the 'refund' event is fired, but it does not appear in GA4 DebugView if 'Send Ecommerce data' is checked. 
                      What could be the reason for this?

Answer >>> If your GA4 tag for the refund event fires in GTM but does not show up in GA4 DebugView when "Send Ecommerce data" is checked, here's the most likely explanation:

✅ Missing Required Ecommerce Parameters
When "Send Ecommerce data" is checked, GA4 expects ecommerce-related parameters — specifically the items array and at least one identifying parameter like transaction_id for refund events.

GA4 Refund event requires:
transaction_id ✅ (Essential to identify which purchase is being refunded)
items ✅ (Optional, but strongly recommended if it's a partial refund)

🔍 Why DebugView doesn't show the event
When you enable "Send Ecommerce data", GA4 applies stricter validation. 
If essential ecommerce parameters like transaction_id are missing, 
GA4: Ignores the event (doesn't show it in DebugView)
Considers it an invalid or incomplete ecommerce event.

==============================================        ===========================
Send Ecommerce data unchecked	                                                           Refund event shows up (loose validation)
Send Ecommerce data checked, missing transaction_id	                                   Refund event doesn't show (strict validation)
Send Ecommerce data checked, with valid transaction_id (+ optional items)	      Refund event shows up ✅
