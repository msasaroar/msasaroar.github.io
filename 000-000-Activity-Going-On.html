<h3>STEP BY STEP ACTIVITIES TRACKING WITH LINKEDIN INSIGHT TAG</h3>
<pre>
Step 1: Create a LinkedIn Campaign Manager Account
- If you don't already have one, create a LinkedIn Campaign Manager account to access the LinkedIn Insight Tag.
- Go to https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager and set up your account.

Step 2: Get Your LinkedIn Insight Tag
1. Log in to LinkedIn Campaign Manager.
2. In the top navigation, click on Account Assets and select Insight Tag.
3. In the Insight Tag section, click See tag to view your LinkedIn Insight Tag code.
    - Copy the provided LinkedIn Insight Tag code (you will need it for Google Tag Manager).

Step 3: Log in to Google Tag Manager (GTM)
- Go to https://tagmanager.google.com/ and log in to your account.
- Select the container where you want to install the LinkedIn Insight Tag.

Step 4: Create a New Tag in GTM
1. In GTM, navigate to the Tags section.
2. Click New to create a new tag.
3. Click on Tag Configuration and select Custom HTML from the list of tag types.
4. Paste the LinkedIn Insight Tag code (copied from LinkedIn Campaign Manager) into the HTML text box.

Step 5: Set Up Triggers for the Tag
1. Click on Triggering and choose a trigger.
    - If you want to track all pages, choose All Pages as the trigger (which will fire the tag on every page of your website).
    - For specific activities like form submissions, use Page View or Custom Events as triggers.
2. You can also set up specific events you want to track, such as page views, form submissions, button clicks, or purchases.

Step 6: Test Your Tag in GTM
1. After setting up the tag and trigger, click Preview in GTM.
2. Open your website in a new tab and test whether the LinkedIn Insight Tag is firing correctly.
    - Use the GTM Preview mode to check if the tag fires properly on the intended pages.
    - If everything looks good, proceed to the next step.

Step 7: Publish Your Changes in GTM
- Once you're sure that the tag is firing correctly, go back to GTM and click Submit to publish your changes.
- This will make the tag live and start tracking activities.

Step 8: Verify Installation of the LinkedIn Insight Tag
1. Go back to LinkedIn Campaign Manager and open the Insight Tag section.
2. Click Check status to verify if the tag has been successfully installed and is collecting data. It may take up to 24 hours for the data to show up.

Step 9: Monitor LinkedIn Insights
- After the tag has been installed and verified, you'll start receiving data in LinkedIn Campaign Manager.
- You can now track page views, conversions, and website activity. LinkedIn uses this data for retargeting and audience analysis.

Step 10: Use Data for Retargeting and Optimization
- In LinkedIn Campaign Manager, use the insights from the activity tracking for setting up retargeting ads, audiences, and conversion tracking. This helps in creating more effective campaigns tailored to your visitors' behaviors.
