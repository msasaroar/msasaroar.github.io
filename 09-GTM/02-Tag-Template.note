How to create tag template on GTM ?

Creating custom variables and tag templates in Google Tag Manager (GTM) lets you extend GTM's built-in functionality. 
Here's a beginner-friendly, step-by-step guide to help you with both:

✅ Part 2: Creating a Custom Tag Template
Custom Tag Templates are advanced and written in GTM’s Template Editor using a restricted sandboxed JavaScript environment.

🔧 Steps to Create One:
In GTM, go to the Templates tab.

Under Tag Templates, click New.

Click on the pencil icon (🖉) to start editing the custom tag.

Give your tag a name, like “My Custom Tag”.

Inside the editor, you'll see tabs for:

Fields: Define custom inputs.

Code: This is where the execution logic goes.

Permissions: Set what your tag can access (like DOM or network).

🧪 Example Code (Simple Console Logger):
In the Fields tab, add a field:

Type: Text

Name: logMessage

Display Name: “Message to Log”

In the Code tab, paste:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const logMessage = data.logMessage || 'Hello from custom tag!';
log(logMessage);
Go to the Permissions tab and check Log to Console.

Save the template.

Now go to Tags > New, and you’ll see “My Custom Tag” as an option.
