GA4 #01: Difference between Google Universal Analytics & GA4

To understand the transition from Google Universal Analytics (UA) to Google Analytics 4 (GA4), here are detailed steps to learn and practice the differences between the two platforms:

Step 1: Overview of UA and GA4
Universal Analytics (UA): Built on a session-based data model, emphasizing page views, user sessions, and hit types like events, pageviews, and transactions.
Google Analytics 4 (GA4): Operates on an event-based data model, tracking user interactions across websites and apps as events. GA4 places a stronger focus on tracking user journeys, privacy, and machine learning insights.
Step 2: Interface Comparison
Log into both platforms: Ensure you have access to both UA and GA4 accounts for comparison.
Explore the Dashboards:
Notice the structural differences. UA has a more rigid report structure, while GA4 allows more flexible, customizable reporting.
GA4 has fewer out-of-the-box reports but provides more options for custom exploration.
Step 3: Data Model Comparison
Session-based (UA) vs. Event-based (GA4):
In UA, data revolves around sessions, with each user session tracking multiple hits (e.g., pageviews, transactions).
GA4 tracks all user interactions as individual events. Every page view, click, and engagement is an event, with no concept of "hits" as in UA.
Key Events in GA4:
GA4 has four categories of events: Automatically Collected, Enhanced Measurement, Recommended Events, and Custom Events.
Explore examples in GA4 to see how these events are categorized.
Step 4: Event Tracking Differences
Explore Event Reporting:
In UA, event tracking requires manual setup for tracking custom events (e.g., clicks, downloads).
In GA4, many common events (scrolling, video engagement) are tracked automatically under “Enhanced Measurement.”
Practice Setting Up a Custom Event:
Use GA4's “Create Event” feature to define a custom event, such as tracking a button click on your website.
Step 5: Reporting & Analysis
Real-time Reports:
Compare the Real-time reports in both UA and GA4. GA4 provides more granular, real-time data, including user engagement with active users and events in the last 30 minutes.
User Analysis:
Look at how user data is presented in both platforms. GA4 includes “User Explorer” and audience-building features that allow for deeper analysis of individual user journeys.
Data Visualization and Customization:
In GA4, use the “Explore” feature to create custom reports that can analyze specific user behaviors and segments, which were limited in UA.
Step 6: Privacy and Data Retention Differences
Privacy-first Approach in GA4:
Understand how GA4 aligns with privacy requirements like GDPR, as it uses anonymization options and has no IP tracking by default.
Data Retention:
Note the differences in data retention periods: UA had longer default data retention, whereas GA4’s default retention is shorter but configurable.
Step 7: Measurement and Conversions
Setting Conversions:
Conversions in UA were typically based on goals, which are session-based, whereas GA4 allows you to set conversions based on events.
Practice Conversion Tracking:
In GA4, mark any event (e.g., a purchase or a form submission) as a conversion by enabling it in the “Events” section.
Step 8: Understanding Attribution Models
Attribution Models in UA vs. GA4:
Review how attribution models differ; GA4 provides multi-touch attribution with options to customize based on last-click, data-driven, and other models.
Experiment with Attribution in GA4:
Explore attribution reports in GA4 to see how different models impact conversion tracking and user flow analysis.
Step 9: Summary and Practice Quiz
After reviewing each difference, summarize what you've learned.
Test your knowledge with a self-quiz or use Google’s skill assessment in GA4.
