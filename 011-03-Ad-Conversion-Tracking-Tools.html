            3. Access to Your Website's Code: Admin or editing rights to the website where the Pixel code will be added.
        
            4. Facebook Page and Ad Account: An associated Facebook Page and an active ad account to manage campaigns.
        
            5. Clear Objectives: Define what you want to track (e.g., purchases, leads, page views).
        
            6. Domain Verification: Verify your domain with Meta to track events reliably (required for some advanced features).
        
            7. Cookies and Privacy Compliance: Update your website's privacy policy and implement consent mechanisms for cookies to comply with GDPR or CCPA.
        
            8. Knowledge of GTM (Optional): If using Google Tag Manager (GTM) to manage the Pixel, familiarity with GTM is helpful.
        
            9. Meta Events Manager Access: For managing and troubleshooting the events triggered by your Pixel.
        
            10. Testing Tools: Use Meta Pixel Helper (a browser extension) to verify Pixel setup and event tracking.

            Steps to Create a Meta Business Account:
            
            1. Log In to Your Facebook Account:

            4. Enter Business Details:
               Fill in your business name, your name, and your business email address.

               Check your email inbox for a verification message from Meta.
               Click the verification link provided to confirm your email address.
            
            6. Set Up Business Assets:
               Once your account is created, you can add assets such as Facebook Pages, Instagram accounts, and Ad Accounts.
               To add these assets:
                 Go to the "Business Settings" within Meta Business Suite.
                 Navigate to the "Accounts" section.
                 Select the type of asset you want to add (e.g., Pages, Ad Accounts, Instagram Accounts).
                 Follow the prompts to add existing assets or create new ones.
            
            7. Assign Roles and Permissions:
               Within "Business Settings," go to the "People" section.
               Click "Add" to invite team members or partners.
               Assign appropriate roles (e.g., Admin, Employee) based on their responsibilities.
            
            8. Domain Verification (Optional but Recommended):
               If you plan to run ads or use advanced features, it's advisable to verify your domain.
               In "Business Settings," navigate to "Brand Safety" > "Domains."
               Click "Add" to enter your domain and follow the provided instructions to verify it.
            
            If you continue to experience issues or the options mentioned are not visible, it's possible that the interface has been updated or there might be regional differences. In such cases, referring to Meta's official documentation or reaching out to their support can provide further assistance.

        <pre>
        <h2 id="Meta-Pixel-Step-By-Step-Events-Setup-Guide">Meta Pixel : Step By Step Events Setup Guide</h2>
        1. Create and Install Facebook Pixel
            Go to Events Manager in your Facebook Business Suite.
            Select Data Sources > Pixels and click Add.
            Name your Pixel, input your website URL, and click Continue.
            Install the Pixel code:
                Choose Manually add Pixel code to website.
                Copy the generated Pixel base code and paste it into the `<head>` section of every page of your website.
        
        2. Verify Pixel Installation
            Use the Meta Pixel Helper Chrome extension to confirm the Pixel is correctly installed.
            Visit your website to check if the Pixel fires events.
        
        3. Set Up Standard Events
            Standard Events include `PageView`, `AddToCart`, `Purchase`, etc.
            To track these events, add the event tracking code to your website:
                Example:
                ```javascript
                fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
                    value: 100.00,
                    currency: 'USD'
                });
                ```
        
        4. Use Facebook Event Setup Tool
            In Events Manager, select your Pixel and click Open Event Setup Tool.
            Enter your website URL and click Open Website.
            Click on elements you want to track (e.g., buttons, links) and assign events to them.
        
        5. Add Custom Events (Optional)
            If predefined events don’t meet your requirements, create custom events:
                Example:
                ```javascript
                fbq('trackCustom', 'CustomEventName', {
                    custom_param1: 'value1',
                    custom_param2: 'value2'
                });
                ```
            Custom events allow for more specific data tracking.
        
        6. Enable Advanced Matching
            In Events Manager, turn on Advanced Matching to send hashed customer data (e.g., email, phone number) for better tracking and attribution.
        
        7. Test Events
            Use the Test Events tab in Events Manager.
            Perform actions on your website (e.g., clicking buttons or making purchases).
            Verify that events appear in real time.
        
        8. Set Up Conversions API (Optional)
            For server-side event tracking, connect your backend to Facebook using the Conversions API.
            Follow the guided setup in Events Manager for integration.
        
        9. Monitor Event Performance
            Use the Events Manager dashboard to analyze the Pixel's event data.
            Identify if events are firing as expected and troubleshoot any issues.
        
        10. Compliance
            Ensure compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations by:
                Adding a cookie consent banner to your website.
                Configuring your Pixel to respect user consent choices.
