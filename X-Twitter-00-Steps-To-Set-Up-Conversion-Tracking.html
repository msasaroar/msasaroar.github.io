Q2Grok(https://x.ai/grok) >>> Steps to Set Up Conversion Tracking with X Pixel
Step 1: Access X Ads Manager
Log into your X account.

Go to ads.x.com or click "Ads" from the side menu on X’s web interface (introduced in 2024 for easier access).

If you’re new to X Ads, set up billing by adding a payment method under "Edit campaign" > "Billing."

Step 2: Navigate to Conversion Tracking Tools
In X Ads Manager, click the "Tools" or "Events Manager" tab (the name may vary slightly based on updates, but it’s typically under the analytics or tracking section).

Select "Conversion Tracking" or "Website Tag" to begin setting up the X Pixel.

Step 3: Create the X Pixel
Click "Create New Conversion Tracking" or "Generate Pixel."

Name your pixel (e.g., "Purchase Tracking") for easy reference.

X will generate a base pixel code—a snippet of JavaScript unique to your account. It looks something like this:

<script>
    !function(e,t,n,s,u,a){e.twq||(s=e.twq=function(){s.exe?s.exe.apply(s,arguments):s.queue.push(arguments);},
    s.version='1.1',s.queue=[],u=t.createElement(n),u.async=!0,u.src='//static.ads-twitter.com/uwt.js',
    a=t.getElementsByTagName(n)[0],a.parentNode.insertBefore(u,a))}(window,document,'script');
    twq('init','your-pixel-id');
    twq('track','PageView');
  </script>

Replace 'your-pixel-id' with the actual ID provided by X.

Step 4: Install the Base Pixel on Your Website
Copy the base pixel code.

Paste it into the <head> section of your website’s HTML on every page you want to track (e.g., all pages for general traffic monitoring).
Option: Use a tag manager (e.g., Google Tag Manager) by adding the script there instead of editing code directly.

Verify the pixel is firing by loading your site and checking the Events Manager in X Ads Manager—it should log a "PageView" event.

Step 5: Define Conversion Events
In the Events Manager, click "Add Event" or "Create Conversion Event."

Choose the type of conversion to track:
Page Load: Tracks visits to a specific URL (e.g., a "thank you" page after purchase).
Enter the URL (e.g., https://yourwebsite.com/thank-you).

Optionally, add rules (e.g., URL contains "thank-you").

Custom Event: Tracks specific actions (e.g., button clicks) with additional code.

For custom events, add an event-specific snippet to the relevant page or action. Example for a "Purchase" event:

<script>
    twq('track', 'Purchase', {
      value: '29.99', // Optional: Conversion value
      currency: 'USD', // Optional: Currency code
      order_id: '12345' // Optional: Unique ID
    });
  </script>

Place this right after the base pixel on the page where the action occurs (e.g., order confirmation).

Step 6: Verify Pixel Installation
Return to Events Manager in X Ads Manager.

Check the "Activity" section to see if events (e.g., PageView, Purchase) are registering as users visit your site.

Use the X Pixel Helper (a browser extension, if available) or your browser’s developer tools (Network tab) to confirm the pixel fires correctly.

Step 7: Link Conversion Tracking to a Campaign
Create or edit a campaign in X Ads Manager.

Select the "Website Clicks" or "Conversions" objective.

Under "Conversion Tracking," choose the pixel and specific event (e.g., "Purchase") you set up.

Set your budget, targeting, and ad creative, then launch the campaign.

X will optimize delivery to users likely to complete the tracked action.

============================================================================
Alternative: Set Up Conversion Tracking with Conversion API
============================================================================
If you prefer server-side tracking (more accurate, especially with privacy restrictions like iOS 14+):
In Events Manager, select "Conversion API" instead of "Pixel."

Generate an API token from X Ads Manager.

Configure your server to send event data (e.g., Purchase, PageView) to X’s API endpoint using HTTP requests. Example payload:

{
    "event_name": "Purchase",
    "event_time": "2025-03-13T10:00:00Z",
    "user_data": {
      "email": "hashed-email@example.com"
    },
    "custom_data": {
      "value": 29.99,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  }

  Work with a developer to integrate this with your website’s backend (e.g., via webhooks or CRM).

  Verify events in the Events Manager and link to campaigns as above.
  
  Tips for Success
  Test First: Use a staging site or low-traffic page to ensure the pixel works before full deployment.
  
  Privacy Compliance: Ensure your site discloses tracking (e.g., cookie consent) per GDPR or CCPA.
  
  Analytics: After setup, monitor results in the "Campaigns" tab—look at "Results" and "Cost per Result" for your conversion event.
