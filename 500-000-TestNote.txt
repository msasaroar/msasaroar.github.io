I didn't make any change in code.(Page No 526, 601)
Both page working fine on preview mode.

1. Showing click_any_element instead of purchase on debug view. (?????526)
2. add_payment_info is showing on debug view. (601)

3. purchase Related data layer including item showing on consol. (526)
4. add_payment_info Related data layer including item showing on consol. (601)

5. purchase is not showing on report. (526)
6. add_payment_info is showing on report (not showing item). (601)



debug => 526 => purchase + purchase => Doesn't Fire
debug => 526 => purchase + purchase_1 => Fired => user defined parameter passed + data layer item info not passed

debug => 601 => add_payment_info + add_payment_info => Fired => user defined parameter passed + data layer item info passed
debug => 601 => add_payment_info + add_payment_info_1 => Fired => user defined parameter passed + data layer item info not passed
