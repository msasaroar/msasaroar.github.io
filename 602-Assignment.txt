GTM Tracking Tasks

1. Page View Tracking
Task    : Track page views and categorize pages (currently non-compliant data layer uses pageCategory instead of page_path).
GTM Implementation:
Create a GA4 Event Tag for page view tracking.
Trigger: Page View trigger.
Action: Push data layer fields into GA4 parameters.


2. Add to Cart
Task: Track product additions to the shopping cart.
GTM Implementation:
Create a GA4 Event Tag for the addToCart event.
Trigger: Click trigger on .add-to-cart buttons.
Action: Pull productID and action from the data layer and send it as event parameters.


3. Navigation Tracking
Task: Track when a user clicks on any navigation link (e.g., "Home," "Products," "Checkout").
GTM Implementation:
Create a GA4 Event Tag for navigation tracking.
Trigger: Click trigger on navigation links.
Action: Send the event name (e.g., navigationClick) and the clickedPage (e.g., "Home" or "Products").


4. Checkout Button Click
Task: Track when a user clicks on the "Checkout" button.
GTM Implementation:
Create a GA4 Event Tag for tracking checkout clicks.
Trigger: Click trigger on the #checkoutBtn element.
Action: Send event data such as event: 'checkoutStart'.


5. Product Page Views
Task: Track when a user views a specific product (e.g., product_1 or product_2).
GTM Implementation:
Create a GA4 Event Tag for product views.
Trigger: Page View or Click on product links.
Action: Track productID or productName as parameters.


6. Custom Data Layer Fields (non-compliant)
Task: Track custom data that may not be fully compliant with GA4â€™s expectations (e.g., userID, currency).
GTM Implementation:
Create a Custom Event tag to track fields like userID or currency.
Trigger: Data Layer Event trigger on custom event pushes.
Action: Map these non-compliant fields to GA4 event parameters (note that GA4 may require restructuring for compliance).

GTM Tag Configuration:
For each of the above tasks, you will need to configure a GA4 Event Tag in Google Tag Manager:
Set the Event Name (e.g., page_view, add_to_cart).
Set Event Parameters (e.g., productID, currency, userID).
Set the Triggering Conditions (e.g., Page View, Click, Data Layer Event).

Note on Non-Compliant Data Layer:
In real-world scenarios, a non-compliant data layer might contain data in formats or fields that GA4 doesn't expect or recommend. 
In this case, you'll likely need to reshape or map the data appropriately within GTM to ensure it is compatible with GA4. For example:


Replace pageCategory with page_path or page_title as per GA4 standards.
Include mandatory fields like client_id or user_id for user-level tracking.
