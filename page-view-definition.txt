What is a "Page View" in Google Tag Manager (GTM)?
In GTM, a "Page View" refers to a standard event that tracks when a page is loaded in a browser. It is typically triggered automatically when the GTM container script is executed on a webpage. Page View events help you track user interactions by collecting data every time a page is viewed.

Steps to Track "Page View" in GTM
Set Up GTM on Your Website

Ensure the GTM container script is installed on all pages of your website.
The GTM container script is usually added to the <head> section and just before the closing </body> tag of your website.
Verify Default Page View Trigger

When you install GTM, it automatically creates a "Page View" trigger by default.
Go to Triggers in GTM and look for a trigger named All Pages. This is the default trigger used to track page views on every page load.
Create a Tag for Page View

Navigate to the Tags section in GTM.
Click on New and name your tag (e.g., "Page View - Google Analytics").
Configure the tag type:
For Google Analytics 4 (GA4): Choose GA4 Configuration tag.
Enter your Measurement ID from GA4.
Select the Trigger as "Page View (All Pages)."
For Universal Analytics (if applicable): Choose Google Analytics - Universal Analytics tag.
Select Page View as the track type.
Enter your Tracking ID (e.g., UA-XXXXXXXXX-X).
Assign the trigger as "Page View (All Pages)."
Save the tag.
Preview Your Setup

Click on the Preview button in GTM to enter Debug mode.
Visit your website to verify if the Page View tag fires correctly on page load.
Use the Tag Assistant in the Preview mode to confirm that the tag is being triggered.
Publish Your Changes

Once confirmed, click on Submit in GTM and publish your container.
Provide a version name (e.g., "Page View Tracking Setup") and description.
Verifying Page View Data in Google Analytics
Open your Google Analytics property.
Go to the Realtime Report to confirm that page views are being tracked in real time.
Check other reports like Engagement or Pages and Screens to view aggregated data over time.
